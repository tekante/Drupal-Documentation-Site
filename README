This is a project that allows for the use of drush make to create a 
Drupal API site for use on a local codebase so that both core, 
contributed and custom modules are indexed

When indexing, if your project uses views, be sure to exclude the 
views/docs directory

To use, checkout the project and then run 
build.sh --dev ../destination_root

Note that the build.sh script was developed on OSX and makes use
of drush, drush make and sed to make the grammar_parser project
